# 2020 AIS Analytics challenge 

Scholastic is a major international publishing, educational, and media company with a focus on books and educational materials 
designed to support children’s literacy and cultivate a passion for reading and knowledge which will continue throughout life. 
Scholastic’s mission is driven by its credo LINK which articulates this goal for the company.Scholastic has many different channels 
through which it distributes the books it publishes. At times these channels work collaboratively to reach new customers in 
different ways, but at times there can be significant overlap between these channels. Through analyzing the interactions of these 
channels Scholastic seeks to better understand the children’s book market, vis-a-vis demographics, geography, genre, and price.
In the spirit of Scholastic’s mission of cultivating learning, the provided data is presented in a realistic manner, as a small 
snapshot of Scholastic’s sales between two separate distribution channels across the nation. In an effort to make this a 
realistic scenario, the data presented is not fully cleaned and there are many additional interesting variables which it is the job
of the analyst to identify and evaluate.

**The questions that need to be answered are shown below.**

1. What trends do you see in the data, among / demographics, genre/ theme, and price?
2. What does the data suggest about Scholastic’s distribution channels, and how would you recommend structuring a distribution strategy?
3. What other publically available data can you append (Census, state, region, etc.), to provide further insight?
4. Formulate a unified strategy for marketing between the two channels.
5. Where are there areas of significant overlap between the channels, and what strategy do you suggest to prevent unintentional competition between channels?
